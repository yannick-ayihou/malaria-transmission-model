#   Malaria Transmission Model

##   Overview
This project develops **mathematical and models** for malaria transmission
It is designed for researchers, students, and public health practitioners to simulate the future dynamics of malaria

### Research Objectives
- Model malaria transmission using **SIR/SEIR frameworks** and vector-borne transmission model
- Incorporate **fractional-order (Caputo) differential equations** for advanced dynamics
- Evaluate the impact of interventions such as **bed nets, treatment, and vaccination
- Provide a **reproducible research pipeline** for malaria modeling studies
